      <h1>Disc Golf 101</h1>

      <h2>Step 1. Pick your discs</h2>
          <p> Driver: this is the disc you will almost always use first for your tee shot. These discs are meant mostly for speed and distance.</p>

          <p> Mid-range: this disc is used mainly for approach shots close to the basket and for tee shots when the basket isn’t too far away. The main goal of a mid-range is accuracy and glide (a disc’s ability to maintain loft or stay in the <br> air). As a new player, your mid-range will be your new best friend.</p>

          <p> Putter: putters are meant to travel short distances as accurately as possible. You will use your putter to either make a very short approach shot or to sink the disc into the basket for hole completion.
          </p>

      <h2>Step 2. Rules</h2>
          <p>When you play disc golf, you will try to throw your disc from a designated tee pad into an upright basket. Each hole has a certain number of throws, or strokes, to get your disc into the basket. If you get your disc into the basket in the correct amount of throws, that’s called par. More throws than par is called a bogey, double bogey, triple bogey, etc. A fewer amount of throws than par is called a birdie, eagle, double eagle, or ace (the classic hole-in-one).
          </p>

          <p>When you throw the first disc, go to the spot it landed. Your next throw will be from that spot. Continue by throwing another disc then go to that spot. Throw again and again until you’re able to throw the disc into the basket or the basket chains. Take your score and put it on a scorecard. Add up the scores from all of your holes. Lowest score, or whoever had the least amount of throws, wins the round.</p>

      <h2>Step 3. Become Aquainted With Loss</h2>
          <p>You will lose discs, be prepared to go swimming or have a tool to grab the disc. Always have your name and number written on the bottom of the disc, almost everyone is kind enough to give you a call if they find it.</p>

      <h2>Step 4. Find a course and throw down</h2>
          <p>There are tons of courses around the world. The easist way to find them is download the App UDisc on IPhone or Android. They have pretty much every course in the world available with pictures. They also have an easy to use score card built right in.</p>
