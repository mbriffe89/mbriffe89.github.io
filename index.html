      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>Hello everyone!</p>      
      <p>My name is Michael Riffe, I was born in a small town in northern Kentucky. I joined the Air Force in 2011 and I work in AMMO, which in simple terms we build and maintain all the explosives the Air Force uses.<br>I have been married to my wife Sarah for the last 7 years and we have two dogs named laynee and Lulu. They are both mini australian shepherds and have unlimited energy. We spend a lot of time outside with them <br>hiking and exploring. We just recently moved to Robins AFB in Georgia, it has been an adjustment because we moved here and then my wife left for OTS shortly after.
      I dont get as much time to take the dogs on hikes<br> and trips to the beach as I would like. </p>

      <p>I have quite a few hobbies that take up the rest of my time when im not out with the dogs. I like to play Disc Golf which is exactly what it sounds like, golf but with special frisbee's. I started it shortly after I moved to Georgia because my coworkers all play and due to a left shoulder injury it's become difficult for me to play regular golf. Another way for me to spend my time is playing video games with my friends around the world. <br>It's a good way for me to keep up those friendships and chill out from the inevitable rough days at work. I play most of the games that <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Blizzard</a> makes and quite a few others that are mainly MMOs. If you are interested in taking up disc golf my friend runs a buisness that does a lot of charity work for children and adoption. You can check out his website Adopt Disc Golf <a href="https://www.adoptdiscgolf.com/" target="_blank">here</a>, or the major retailer I use is <a href="https://mvpdiscsports.com/" target="_blank">MVP Disc Sports</a>.</p>
